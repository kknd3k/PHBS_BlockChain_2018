# Introduction
For a common currency, its value is related to factors like the economic power of one country and domestic capital return. But bitcoin is a different thing. Van Wijk (2013) thinks that bitcoin is actually a string of code. It's worth intrinsically nothing. Can we still apply some classic economic model on bitcoin price formation? Or should we found new determinants or models to explain it?
<br>
<br>So I collected some literatures focus on bitcoin price formation. Actually this is a tough problem. And most of papers didn't provide a feasible model that can be used for prediction. It seems that bitcoin price is more efficient than I expect. Eventually, I still found some factors related to bitcoin price.
