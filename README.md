# Introduction
For a common currency, its value is related to factors like the economic power of one country and domestic capital return. But bitcoin is a different thing. Van Wijk (2013) thinks that bitcoin is actually a string of code. It's worth intrinsically nothing. Can we still apply some classic economic model on bitcoin price formation? Or should we found new determinants or models to explain it?
<br>
<br>So I collected some literatures focus on bitcoin price formation. Actually this is a tough problem. And most of papers didn't provide a feasible model that can be used for prediction. It seems that bitcoin price is more efficient than I expect. Eventually, I still found some factors related to bitcoin price.

## 1.The Economics of BitCoin Price Formation(Ciaian et al. 2016)
This is a widely used paper following the main idea of Van Wijk (2013). It researched on bitcoin price formation by combining three types of bitcoin price determinants identified in the previous literature: market forces of supply and demand, investors' behavior and global financial development, and to account for their interactions.

### The methodology
B represents the total stock of BitCoins in circulation and EX is the exchange rate of BitCoin. The total BitCoin supply, MS, is given by:<space>**MS=EX*B**
<br>
<br>And the demand of bitcoin MD is given by:<space>**MD=P*Y/V**
<br>
<br>P is the general price level of goods and services.Y is the size of BitCoin economy, and V is the velocity of BitCoin circulation. The BitCoin’s velocity, V, measures the frequency at which one unit of BitCoin is used for purchase of goods and services, and it depends on the opportunity cost for holding it (inflation, opportunity interest rate).
<br>
<br>Under market equilibrim condition:
<space>**MS=MD**
<br>
<br>So we have:<space>**EX= P*Y/(V*B)**
<br>This equation under logarithmic transformation is:
